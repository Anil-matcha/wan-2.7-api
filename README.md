# Wan 2.7: The Next Generation Video Foundation Model

**Wan 2.7** represents the cutting-edge evolution in Alibaba Cloud's video generation series, succeeding the professional-grade **Wan 2.6**. 

Building upon the "Reference-to-Video" (R2V) and native audio-visual synchronization of its predecessor, Wan 2.7 pushes the boundaries of cinematic AI, long-form storytelling, and visual consistency.

## Evolution: From Wan 2.6 to Wan 2.7

### Previous Model: Wan 2.6 (Late 2025)
Wan 2.6 was a major milestone that moved beyond simple clips to professional-grade production:
- **Reference-to-Video (R2V):** Enabled "clone-level" character consistency by uploading a reference video, maintaining appearance and motion patterns.
- **Smart Multi-Shot Storytelling:** Automated the generation of multi-angle scenes (panoramic, close-ups, tracking shots) within a single 15-second 1080p clip.
- **Native AV Sync:** First in the series to offer native lip-syncing and synchronized environmental sound effects (SFX) that match on-screen motion.
- **Dual-Subject Interaction:** Supported high-fidelity interaction between up to two distinct characters.

### Next Generation: Wan 2.7 (Early 2026 Roadmap)
Wan 2.7 refines the core architecture of 2.6, focusing on scaling, endurance, and granular control:

#### 1. Extended Narrative Windows (30s - 60s)
While Wan 2.6 capped at 15 seconds, Wan 2.7 is engineered for extended durations, targeting **30 to 60 seconds** of continuous, high-fidelity video in a single generation pass without losing temporal coherence.

#### 2. Global Character Embedding & Persistence
Beyond 2.6's R2V, Wan 2.7 introduces **Persistent Character VAEs**, allowing the model to "memorize" character features across an entire project. This enables full-length AI filmmaking with a consistent cast across separate scenes.

#### 3. Instruction-Based Video Editing
Wan 2.7 moves from simple generation to **dynamic editing**. It supports natural language instructions to modify existing footage (e.g., *"Change the lighting to sunset"* or *"Add a futuristic helmet to the character"*), preserving the original motion and structure while altering specific elements.

#### 4. Advanced Physical Simulation (v4)
The updated **Wan-VAE v4** significantly improves the simulation of complex physics, including realistic fluid dynamics (water, fire), cloth physics, and high-speed motion blur without the "warping" artifacts seen in earlier diffusion models.

#### 5. Full Binaural Audio Synthesis
Succeeding the basic SFX of 2.6, Wan 2.7 generates **Spatial Binaural Audio** that dynamically shifts based on the camera's position and the movement of objects in the scene.
